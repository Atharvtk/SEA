## 1. Top 10 Countries by Confirmed COVID-19 Cases

**Findings:**  
The analysis of the top 10 countries by confirmed COVID-19 cases reveals vastly disproportionate case counts, with the most affected countries having much higher numbers than others. This suggests local factors like population density, government measures, and health infrastructure decisively influenced the pandemic trajectory. The steep dropoff after the most affected nations demonstrates the global heterogeneity of the outbreak.

## 2. Top 10 Countries by COVID-19 Deaths

**Findings:**  
Countries shown here suffered the highest fatality numbers. Some rank similarly to their confirmed cases, but others diverge, indicating differences in healthcare robustness, demographics, or reporting practices. Such data is critical for understanding where health resources and emergency interventions saved lives or where vulnerabilities existed.

---

## 3. Confirmed Cases Distribution by WHO Region

**Findings:**  
A breakdown by WHO Region shows uneven regional impacts. Some regions face a greater disease burden—helpful for global planners to identify priority areas and regional policy variations affecting pandemic spread.

---

## 4. Deaths vs. Confirmed Cases (Zoomed Scatter Plot)

**Findings:**  
Most countries cluster toward lower confirmed cases and deaths, with few outliers at higher values. A zoomed perspective reveals meaningful spread among mid-tier countries, helping identify unexpected mortality rates or exceptionally effective health responses.

---

## 5. Top 10 Countries by Recovery Rate

**Findings:**  
Countries with the highest recovery rates show impressive management and treatment strategies. After filtering out statistical outliers, high rates indicate successful control and care, helping set benchmarks for others.

---

## 6. Top 10 Countries by 1 Week % Increase in Confirmed Cases

**Findings:**  
Growth rates spotlight emerging hotspots. Countries with rapidly rising cases warrant immediate health interventions and close surveillance to halt further escalation.

---

## 7. Top 10 Countries by New COVID-19 Cases

**Findings:**  
Monitoring countries with high new case counts directs attention toward locations needing urgent containment efforts, even if their cumulative cases aren't the highest.

---

## **Overall Conclusion**

Multiple visualizations collectively showcase the pandemic's complexity, revealing hotspots, success stories, and ongoing risks. These findings are crucial for guiding public health policy, resource allocation, and future strategic responses.
